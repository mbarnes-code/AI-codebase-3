# Frontend App Setup

The frontend uses [Next](https://nextjs.org/) to create the app.

## Installation Requirements

See the [Getting Started instructions](../README.md#getting-started) for details about installing node.

## Build Setup

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev
```

If you want to see how the app will behave in production, build and run it:

```bash
# build for production (this will take a while)
yarn build
# runs the site in prod mode using the generated pages from the build-frontend step
yarn start
```
